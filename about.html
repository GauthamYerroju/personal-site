                    <p>
                        I am Gautham Yerroju. Born and raised (mostly) in Hyderabad India, I am surprisingly averse to Biriyani. I am tall dark and handsome (and a little narcissistic to be saying that myself). I am an INFP, nicknamed the Idealist and the Dreamer. I constantly try to find my place in the universe and think about the big questions, like why I keep losing my keys.

                    <p>
                        I completed my undergraduation in Computer Science and Engineering in J.B. Institute of Engineering and Technology. I worked for over 3 years in teh Fortune 100 company FactSet Research Systems as an automation analyst, where I have learned about automation, front-end and backend web development, databases and much more.

                    <p>
                        I love to code and design. I have learned to code in school trying to make games and it stuck for life. Under my toolbelt I have knowledge of Object Oriented programming in almost all the languages I know, which include Ruby, Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, PHP and a few more scripting languages. My role in FactSet gave me experience as a full-stack web developer among other things.

                As an INFP, nicknamed the <a href="https://www.personalitypage.com/INFP.html">Idealist</a> and the <a href="http://www.mypersonality.info/personality-types/infp/">Dreamer</a>, I constantly try to find my place in the universe and think about the big questions.

                Although, I believe no test can do justice to the unique blend of genetics and life experiences that make me who I am. Multiple tests and a blood sample might do the trick, but I wouldn't know.

            <p>
                I code for a living and also for fun. I learned to code on my own when I was 14 years old trying to make games, and it kind of stuck. For life.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started off with making addons for RPG Maker XP and a few games in Python and Java. In my job, I honed my <a href="https://xkcd.com/196/">command line fu</a> and learned full-stack web development among other things like PowerPoint presentations, late night meetings, bi-monthly parties and being more awesome.

            <p>
                I may not be an artist by profession, but it's a hobby I developed when I wanted to make my own posters. I have a good eye for proportions and perspective. Coding has taken time away from developing this skill, but I channeled it into 2D graphic design. I have made many graphic game resourses for the Chaos Project game making community.

            <p>
                I see games as a unique form art, where the artists pull you into a different world and let you interact with it. Games, to me, are also examples of great design and awesome technical achievements. I always wondered how they managed to fit so many Pokemon into those tiny GBA cartridges...
            </p>
            <p>
                I love role playing games like Chrono Trigger, Mass Effect, and really anything with a good story. Though RPGs are my favorite type of games, I also favor 3PS, RTS and FPS genres among other types of games.
