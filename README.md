# Personal Website

This is the repo for my personal website http://gauthamyerroju.com

It is build from the ground up with Normalize + a CSS grid system as the base.

## If you want to fork this...

Just keep in mind that I plan to change my GitHub username soon (January), after which I will move this code to a github.io repo, as I want to host my website on GitHub Pages.
