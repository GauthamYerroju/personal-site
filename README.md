## UPDATE:
Since deploying this website, my web host [Hostinger](https://www.hostinger.com/) decided to remove free hosting and decided to axe my website without informing me in any way.

http://gauthamyerroju.com now hosts my new website (a blog, actually), and this project is available at http://gauthamyerroju.com/personal-site.

I am still working on improving my blog and this project (or some form of it) will reside on an Aboutpag eon my new site.

# Personal Website

This is the repo for my personal website http://gauthamyerroju.com

It is build from the ground up with Normalize + a CSS grid system as the base.

## If you want to fork this...

Just keep in mind that I plan to change my GitHub username soon (January), after which I will move this code to a github.io repo, as I want to host my website on GitHub Pages.
